    "text": "Complete tutorial and code\n\n\n\nSee the full tutorial here. You can also see the tutorial’s code here and the code for the final API here.\n\n\nFor years, I’ve tracked all sorts of data about myself (and my family) through Google Forms, Airtable, and devices like Fitbits to keep track of all sorts of things: personal goals, progress of research projects, current health status, books read, and so on.\nIt’s nice to have all this data, but it’s hard to use it all immediately. I often look at it at the end of the year, or every few months, or whatever, but having an instant snapshot is helpful too. That’s why people invented data dashboards, after all.\nI like R a lot, and R has the ability to make dashboards, like with {flexdashboard} and Shiny. I’ve made several dashboards for tracking things like health and reading and research—I even have a blog post about making one with {flexdashboard}!\nBut I’ve always run into issues with getting live data. With {flexdashboard}, you can make it grab the most recent version of the data you’re interested in when you knit the document, but then to update the graphs and tables in the document, you have to re-knit it. With Shiny, there are ways to dynamically grab the latest data, but then you have to run a whole Shiny server, and that’s hard and costs money and it’s slow—it can sometimes take a few minutes to reanimate a hibernating Shiny app!\nHowever, nowadays it’s possible to use Observable JS chunks in Quarto that automatically grab live data from the internet and display it, like this:\n\n\nShow the OJS code\n```{ojs}\n//| echo: fenced\n//| code-fold: true\n//| code-summary: \"Show the OJS code\"\nd3 = require('d3')\n\nviewof year_to_show = Inputs.radio([\"2023\", \"2024\"], {value: \"2023\", label: \"Year to show\"})\n\nbooks = await d3.json(\n  \"https://api.andrewheiss.com/books_simple?year=\" + year_to_show\n)\n\nbook_noun = (books.count[0] === 1 ? \" book read\" : \" books read\")\n\nPlot.plot({\n  title: books.count[0] + book_noun + \" in \" + year_to_show,\n  y: {\n    label: \"Books read\",\n    grid: false,\n    percent: false\n  },\n  x: {\n    label: \"Month\",\n    domain: books.monthly_count.map(d =&gt; d.read_month_fct),\n  },\n  marks: [\n    Plot.ruleY([0]),\n    Plot.axisX({label: null, ticks: null}),\n    Plot.axisY({label: null, ticks: null}),\n\n    Plot.barY(books.monthly_count, {\n      x: \"read_month_fct\", \n      y: \"count\", \n      fill: \"#f3752f\",\n      tip: {\n        format: {\n          x: true,\n          y: true\n        }\n      }\n    })\n  ]\n})\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now that Quarto supports dashboards, you can create entire Shiny-like dashboards that can load and display data without needing a Shiny server. Like this one!\nThe trickiest part of all this, though, is getting data from all around the internet (Google Sheets, Airtable databases, RSS feeds, Fitbit, etc.) into an easily accessible, clean, and usable format that you can feed into things like Observable plots or R.\nFortunately there’s a good (and really neat!) solution for this! You can use the {plumber} R package to create your own API that you can use to grab and clean data from all around the internet. And to simplify life, you can use other services like Make.com to deal with the hard work of regularly checking in on different parts of the internet (checking RSS feeds, reading Google/Airtable data, logging into services like Fitbit).\nIn the end, you can have a server like api.yourname.com and access JSON, CSV, or .rds data like api.yourname.com/books?start_date=2024-01-01. You can then use that in an R file, in a Python script, or in a Quarto document with Observable JS.

    "text": "Abstract\nThe phenomenon of closing civic space has adversely impacted INGO funding. We argue that individual private donors can be important in sustaining the operations of INGOs working in repressive contexts. Individual donors do not use the same performance-based metrics as official aid donors. Rather, trust can be an important component of individual donor support for nonprofits working towards difficult goals. How does trust in charitable organizations influence individuals’ preferences to donate, especially when these groups face crackdown? Using a simulated market for philanthropic donations based on data from a nationally representative sample of individuals in the United States who regularly donate to charity, we find that trust in INGOs matters substantially in shaping donor preferences. Donor profiles with high levels of social trust are likely to donate to INGOs with friendly relationships with host governments. This support holds steady if INGOs face criticism or crackdown. In contrast, donor profiles with lower levels of social trust prefer to donate to organizations that do not face criticism or crackdown abroad. The global crackdown on NGOs may thus possibly sour NGOs’ least trusting individual donors. Our findings have practical implications for INGOs raising funds from individuals amid closing civic space."
